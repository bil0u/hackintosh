# Coffee-Lake Hackintosh

On this repo you will find the configuration of my hackintosh that i use everyday for working and gaming.

It's been a long journey since the purchase of the components fixing bugs and testing different bootloaders, but it runs incredibly smooth now, and i'm so much happy with it.

## Bootloader

This hackintosh runs on [OpenCore v0.7.5 release](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg) from [acidanthera](https://github.com/acidanthera).

> I was previously using Clover, never again !

## Configuration

I'm currently running **macOS 10.13.6 build 17G14019** vanilla and **Windows 10** on the same drive.

Quick hardware tour : **Intel Core i9 9900-K** & **NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti** on the **Gigabyte Z390 Aorus Master**.  
_â†’ Full hardware list [here](/docs/hardware.md)_

I followed these install steps :

1. **macOS + OpenCore** : official dortania [install guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide).
2. **Windows 10** : the steps described [here](/docs/windows_install.md)

Have a look at the [bios settings](/docs/bios_settings.md) and [config](/docs/config.md) I use.

I wrote an update memo, you can see it [here](/docs/update.md)

## Tools

I built some useful tools, feel free to use them :

- [manage_config](/tools/manage_config.py) : useful for clear secrets in your config.plist before adding it to version control.

  ```shell script
  usage: python3 tools/manage_config.py [-h] [-c CONFIG] [-b BACKUP] {backup,clean,restore}

  Manage OpenCore configuration secrets

  positional arguments:
    {backup,clean,restore}
                      command to execute. clean makes also a backup

  optional arguments:
    -h, --help        show this help message and exit
    -c CONFIG, --config CONFIG
                      target configuration
    -b BACKUP, --backup BACKUP
                      backup file destination. we recommend to put a .json extension
  ```

- [custom_atm](/tools/custom_atm.py): customizes the 'About this Mac' panel.

  ```shell script
  usage: python3 tools/custom_atm.py [-h] [--system-logo SYSTEM_LOGO] [--model-name MODEL_NAME] [--processor-name PROCESSOR_NAME]

  Customizes 'About this Mac' section of a macOS system

  optional arguments:
    -h, --help        show this help message and exit
    --system-logo SYSTEM_LOGO
                      system logo to use. logo format must be TIFF
    --model-name MODEL_NAME
                      custom model name
    --processor-name PROCESSOR_NAME
                      custom processor name
  ```
